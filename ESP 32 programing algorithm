	Define the ship on Arduino software. go to: Tools > board > board manager > copy the ship link from the datasheet.
  Define bins' names and functions (input, output,....etc).
  Install the needed packages on Arduino software.
  connect the ship with the laptop, then in the software go to Tools > Board ESP32 Dev Module > ESP32 Dev Module
  check the port number to insure getting a correct connection.
  Write the appropriate code to the project.
  Defining variables for each extra material that will be linked to the esp32c ship is essential.
	For example, the following code will link a little lamp we want to attach to the ship.

              int L =3;              \\  3 is the bin number that the lamp is clasped too
              void setup(){
              pinMode( L ,OUTPUT);
                          }           \\  OUTPUT is the declaration of the bin to be as an input or output. 
  Press upload and the button in the ship until a leaving message appears 
	Press restart button to run the code
